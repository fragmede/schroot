.TH DCHROOT 1 "28 Jan 2006" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
dchroot \- enter a chroot environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dchroot
[\fIOPTION\fP]... [\fICOMMAND\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdchroot\fP allows the user to run a command or a login shell in a chroot
environment.  If no command is specified, a login shell will be started in the
user's current working directory inside the chroot.
.PP
This version of \fBdchroot\fP is a compatibility wrapper around the
.BR schroot (1)
program.  It is provided for backward compatibility with the \fBdchroot\fP
command-line options, but \fBschroot\fP is recommended for future use.  See the
section \[lq]\fIMigration\fP\[rq] below for help migrating your existing
\fBdchroot\fP configuration to \fBschroot\fP.  See the section
\[lq]\fIIncompatibilities\fP\[rq] below for known incompatibilities with
\fBdchroot\fP.
.PP
If no chroot is specified, the chroot name or alias \fBdefault\fP will be used
as a fallback.  If using the configuration in \fI@DCHROOT_CONF@\fP, the first
chroot in the file is the default.
.SH OPTIONS
Note that the original \fBdchroot\fP did not provide long options.
\fBdchroot\fP accepts the following options:
.SS Basic options
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help summary.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Select all chroots.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-chroot=\fIchroot\fP
Specify a chroot to use.  This option may be used multiple times to specify
more than one chroot, in which case its effect is similar to \fB\-\-all\fP.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List all available chroots.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-info
Print detailed information about the specified chroots.  Note that the original
\fBdchroot\fP did not include this option.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-path
Print location (path) of the specified chroots.
.TP
.B \-\-config
Print configuration of the specified chroots.  This is useful for testing that
the configuration in use is the same as the configuration file.  Any comments
in the original file will be missing.  Note that the original \fBdchroot\fP did
not include this option.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-preserve\-environment
Preserve the user's environment inside the chroot environment.  The default is
to use a clean environment; this option copies the entire user environment and
sets it in the session.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Print only essential messages.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print all messages.  Note that the original \fBdchroot\fP did not include this
option.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The original \fBdchroot\fP configuration file, \fI@DCHROOT_CONF@\fP has the
following format:
.IP \[bu]
\[oq]#\[cq] starts a comment line.
.IP \[bu]
Blank lines are ignored.
.IP \[bu]
Chroot definitions are a single line containing an \fIidentifier\fP,
\fIpath\fP, and an optional \fIpersonality\fP separated by whitespace.  The
first chroot is also the default.
.PP
An example file:
.PP
.RS
\f[CR]# Example comment\fP
.br
\f[CR]\fP
.br
\f[CR]sarge /srv/chroot/sarge\fP
.br
\f[CR]sid /srv/chroot/sid linux32\fP
.br
.RE
.PP
This file defines a chroot called \[oq]sarge\[cq], located at
\fI/srv/chroot/sarge\fP, and a second chroot called \[oq]sid\[cq], located at
\fI/srv/chroot/sid\fP.  The second chroot uses the \[lq]linux32\[rq]
personality, which allows a 32-bit chroot to be used on a 64-bit system.
\[oq]sarge\[cq] is the default chroot, because it was listed first, which means
if the \fI\-c\fP option is omitted, this chroot will be used.
.SH INCOMPATIBILITIES
.SS Debian dchroot prior to version 0.99.
.IP \[bu]
Log messages are worded and formatted differently.
.IP \[bu]
The parsing of \fI@DCHROOT_CONF@\fP uses a smaller list of allowed whitespace
characters (space and tab), which may cause a parse error during tokenising if
the file contains odd characters as separators, such as carriage returns,
vertical tabs and form feeds.
.IP \[bu]
\fBdchroot\fP provides a restricted subset of the functionality implemented by
\fBschroot\fP, but is still \fBschroot\fP underneath.  Thus \fBdchroot\fP is
still subject to \fBschroot\fP security checking, including PAM authentication
and authorisation, and session management, for example, and hence may behave
slightly differently to the older \fBdchroot\fP in some circumstances.
.SS DSA dchroot
Machines run by the Debian System Administrators for the Debian Project have a
\fBdchroot-dsa\fP package which provides an alternate \fBdchroot\fP
implementation.
.IP \[bu]
All the above incompatibilities apply.
.IP \[bu]
This version of dchroot has incompatible command-line options, and while some
of those options are supported or have equivalent options by a different name,
the \fI\-c\fP option is not required to specify a chroot, and this version of
dchroot cannot implement this behaviour in a backward-compatible manner
(because if \fI\-c\fP is omitted, the default chroot is used).  DSA dchroot
uses the first non-option as the chroot to use, only allowing one chroot to be
used at once.
.IP \[bu]
This version of dchroot has an incompatible format for \fIdchroot.conf\fP.
While the first two fields are the same, the remaining fields are an optional
list of users permitted to access the chroot, instead of the personality field
allowed by this version.  If access restrictions are needed, please use
\fIschroot.conf\fP and add the allowed users there, as shown in
\[lq]\fIMigration\fP\[rq] below.
.SH MIGRATION
To migrate an existing \fBdchroot\fP configuration to \fBschroot\fP, perform
the following steps:
.IP 1
Dump the \fBdchroot\fP configuration in \fBschroot\fP keyfile format to
\fI@SCHROOT_CONF@\fP.
.PP
.RS
\f[CR]# \f[CB]dchroot --config >> @SCHROOT_CONF@
.br
.RE
.PP
.IP 2
Edit \fI@SCHROOT_CONF@\fP to add access to the groups who are to be allowed to
access the chroots, and make any other desired changes to the configuration.
See
.BR schroot.conf (5).
.IP 3
Remove \fI@DCHROOT_CONF@\fP, so that \fBdchroot\fP will subsequently use
\fI@SCHROOT_CONF@\fP for its configuration.
.SH EXAMPLES
\f[CR]$ dchroot \-l\fP
.br
\f[CR]Available chroots: sarge [default], sid\fP
.br
\f[CR]\fP
.br
\f[CR]$ dchroot \-p sid\fP
.br
\f[CR]/srv/chroot/sid\fP
.br
\f[CR]\fP
.br
\f[CR]$ dchroot \-q \-c sid \-\- uname \-smr\fP
.br
\f[CR]Linux 2.6.16.17 ppc\fP
.br
\f[CR]\fP
.br
\f[CR]$ dchroot \-c sid\fP
.br
\f[CR]I: [sid chroot] Running login shell: \[lq]/bin/bash\[rq]\fP
.br
\f[CR]$ \fP
.br
.LP
Use \fB\-\-\fP to allow options beginning with \[oq]\-\[cq] or \[oq]\-\-\[cq]
in the command to run in the chroot.  This prevents them being interpreted as
options for \fBschroot\fP itself.  Note that the top line was echoed to
standard error, and the remaining lines to standard output.  This is
intentional, so that program output from commands run in the chroot may be
piped and redirected as required; the data will be the same as if the command
was run directly on the host system.
.SH BUGS
None known at this time.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I @DCHROOT_CONF@
The system-wide \fBdchroot\fP chroot definition file.  This file must be owned
by the root user, and not be writable by other.  If present, this file will be
used in preference to @SCHROOT_CONF@.
.TP
.I @SCHROOT_CONF@
The system-wide \fBschroot\fP definition file.  This file must be owned by the
root user, and not be writable by other.  It is recommended that this file be
used in preference to \fI@DCHROOT_CONF@\fP, because the chroots can be used
interchangeably with \fBschroot\fP, and the group security policies provided by
\fBschroot\fP are also enforced.
.SH AUTHORS
Roger Leigh.
.PP
This implementation of \fBdchroot\fP uses the same command-line options as the
original \fBdchroot\fP by David Kimdon <dwhedon@debian.org>, but is an
independent implementation.

 * When SbuildAuth needs to interact with the user, it does this by
 * sending a set of #SbuildAuthMessage structures to an
 * #SbuildAuthConv conversation object.  These messages tell the
 * conversation object how to display the message to the user, and if
 * necessary, whether or not to ask the user for some input.

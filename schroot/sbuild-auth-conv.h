   * This is a wrapper around the struct pam_conv PAM conversation
   * interface, and is used by Auth when interacting with the user
   * during authentication.
   *
   * A simple implementation is provided in the form of AuthConvTty.

   * The interface allows the setting of optional warning timeout and
   * fatal timeout values, which should default to 0 (not enabled).
   * This is an absolute time after which a warning is displayed or
   * the conversation ends with an error.

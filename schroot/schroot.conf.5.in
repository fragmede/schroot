.TH SCHROOT.CONF 5 "17 Jun 2005" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
schroot.conf \- chroot definition file for schroot
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild.conf\fP is a plain UTF-8 text file, describing the chroots available
for use with sbuild.
.PP
Comments are introduced following a \[oq]\f[CR]\[sh]\fP\[cq] (\[lq]hash\[rq])
character at the beginning of a line, or following any other text.  All text
right of the \[oq]\f[CR]\[sh]\fP\[cq] is treated as a comment.
.PP
A chroot is defined as a group of key-value pairs, which is started by a name
in square brackets on a line by itself.  The file may contain multiple groups
which therefore define multiple chroots.
.PP
A chroot definition is started by the name of the chroot in square brackets.
For example,
.IP
\f[CR]\[lB]sid\[rB]
.PP
This is then followed by several key-value pairs:
.TP
.B description=\fIdescription\fP
A short description of the chroot.
.TP
.B location=\fIdirectory\fP
The directory containing the chroot environment.  This is where the root will
be changed to when executing a login shell or a command.  The directory
 must exist and have read and execute permissions to allow users' access to it.
.TP
.B priority=\fInumber\fP
Set the priority of a chroot.  \fInumber\fP is a positive integer indicating
whether a distribution is older than another.  For example, \[lq]oldstable\[rq]
and \[lq]oldstable-security\[rq] might be 0, while \[lq]stable\[rq] and
\[lq]stable-security\[rq] 1, \[lq]testing\[rq] 2 and \[lq]unstable\[rq] 3.  The
values are not important, but the difference between them is.  This is used by
sbuild when using the schroot chroot mode.
.TP
.B groups=\fIgroup1,group2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed access to the chroot.  If
empty or omitted, no users will be allowed access.
.TP
.B root\-groups=\fIgroup1,group2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed \fBpassword-less\fP root
access to the chroot.  If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed root
access without a password (but if a user's group is in \fBgroups\fP, they may
gain access with a password).
.TP
.B aliases=\fIalias1,alias2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of aliases (alternate names) for this chroot.  For
example, a chroot named \[lq]sid\[rq] might have an \[lq]unstable\[rq] alias
for convenience.
.PP
The configuration format is an INI-style format used by the GLib GKeyFile
class, and is fully documented in the GLib API reference.  Here, only the
features used and required by schroot are documented.

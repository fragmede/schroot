/**

 * @short_description: authentication conversation interface
 * @title: SbuildAuthConv
 *
 * SbuildAuthConv is an interface which should be implemented by
 * objects which handle interaction with the user during
 * authentication.
 *
 * This is a wrapper around the struct pam_conv PAM conversation
 * interface, and is used by #SbuildAuth when interacting with the
 * user during authentication.
 *
 * A simple implementation is provided in the form of
 * #SbuildAuthConvTty.  However, more complex implementations might
 * hook into the GLib main loop, or implement it in a #GtkWidget.
 *
 * The interface allows the setting of optional warning timeout and
 * fatal timeout values, which default to 0 (not enabled).  This is an
 * absolute time after which a warning is displayed or the
 * conversation ends with an error.

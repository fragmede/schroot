.TH SCHROOT 1 "17 Jun 2005" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
schroot \- securely enter a chroot environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B schroot
[\fIOPTION\fP]... [\fICOMMAND\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\fP allows the user to run a command or a login shell in a chroot
environment.  If no command is specified, a login shell will be started in the
user's current working directory inside the chroot.
.PP
If the user is not a member of the allowed groups (or if changing to root, the
allowed root groups) for the specified chroot(s), the user will be required to
authenticate themselves (typically with a password, but this depends upon the
PAM configuration).  All chroot usage will be logged in the system logs.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBschroot\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Use all chroots.  When a command has been specified, the command will be run in
all chroots.  If \fB\-\-info\fP has been used, display information about all
chroots.  This option does not make sense to use with a login shell (when no
command has been specified).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-chroot=\fIchroot\fP
Specify a chroot to use.  This option may be used multiple times to specify
more than one chroot, in which case its effect is similar to \fB\-\-all\fP.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-user=\fIuser\fP
Run as a different user.  The default is to run as the current user.  If
required, the user may be required to authenticate themselves with a password.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List all available chroots.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-info
Print detailed information about the specified chroots.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-preserve\-environment
Preserve the user's environment inside the chroot environment.  The default is
to use a clean environment; this option copies the entire environment.  This
option is not yet implemented.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Print only essential messages.  This option is not yet implemented.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information.
.SH BUGS
None known at this time.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I @prefix@/etc/schroot.conf
The system-wide chroot definition file.  This file must be owned by the root
user, and not be writable by other.
.TP
.I /etc/pam.d/schroot
PAM configuration.

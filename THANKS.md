# Thank you

`schroot` was originally written by Roger Leigh
<rleigh@codelibre.net>.  It would not be what it is today without the
invaluable help of these people:

- Andreas Bombe <aeb@debian.org>
- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>
- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>
- Martin Michlmayr <tbm@debian.org>
- Lucas Nussbaum <lucas@debian.org>
- Adeodato Simó <adeodato@debian.org>

I would like to thank all of the above for their many suggestions,
feature requests and bug reports.  Without their destruction testing
and help, `schroot` would not have been pushed as far as it has.  I
would also like to thanks the following people for their specific
contributions:

- Zach Carter <z.carter@f5.com>
  * Packaging for Fedora.
  * Bugfixes and patches.
- Ben Hutchings <benh@debian.org>
  * Help with many C++ problems, especially the intricacies of
    templates and other obscure and annoying language features.
- Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>
  * GNU/kFreeBSD porting.
- Simon Richter <sjr@debian.org>
  * Help with PAM session handling.

# This script is an example of how to use the "custom" chroot type.
# This simple example replicates some of the functionality of the
# "directory" chroot type, using the "custom.dir" setting in place
# of the "directory" setting, which sets CUSTOM_DIR in the script
# environment.  Here, we bind mount it as would normally happen for
# the directory type.
#
# Note that this replicates some of the 10mount logic, and does not
# handle recovery, so is not completely robust.  This will require
# reworking or splitting of 10mount into separate pieces in order
# to handle custom types without working the logic for the custom
# types into 10mount directly (currently the recommended course of
# action).

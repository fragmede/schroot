.TH SCHROOT\-SETUP 5 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
schroot\-setup \[em] schroot chroot setup scripts
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBschroot\fP uses scripts to to set up and then clean up the chroot
environment.  The directories \f[BI]@SCHROOT_CONF_SETUP_D@\fP and
\f[BI]@SCHROOT_CONF_EXEC_D@\fP contain scripts run when a chroot is created and
destroyed, and entered and left, respectively.  Several environment variables
are set while the scripts are being run, which allows their behaviour to be
customised, depending upon, for example, the type of chroot in use.
.PP
The scripts are run in name order, like those run by
.BR init (8),
by using the same style of execution as
.BR run-parts (8).
.PP
The setup scripts are all invoked with two options:
.IP 1
The action to perform.
.IP
When a session is first started, the chroot is set up by running the scripts in
@SCHROOT_CONF_SETUP_D@ with the \[oq]setup\-start\[cq] option.  When a command
or shell is run in the configured chroot, the scripts in
\fI@SCHROOT_CONF_EXEC_D@\fP are run with the \[oq]exec\-start\[cq] option.
After the command or command has completed, the scripts are run in reverse
order with the \[oq]exec\-stop\[cq] option.  Finally, when the session is
ended, the scripts in \fI@SCHROOT_CONF_SETUP_D@\fP are run in reverse order
with the \[oq]setup\-stop\[cq] option.
.IP 2
The chroot status.
.IP
This is either \[oq]ok\[cq] if there are no problems, or \[oq]fail\[cq] if
something went wrong.  For example, particular actions may be skipped on
failure.
.PP
Note that the scripts should be \fIidempotent\fP.  They \fBmust\fP be
idempotent during the \[oq]exec\-stop\[cq] and \[oq]setup\-stop\[cq] phases,
because they may be run more than once.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SS General variables
.TP
AUTH_USER
The username of the user the command in the chroot will run as.
.TP
AUTH_VERBOSITY
Set to \[oq]quiet\[cq] if only error messages should be printed,
\[oq]normal\[cq] if other messages may be printed as well, and
\[oq]verbose\[cq] if all messages may be printed.
.TP
MOUNT_DIR
The directory under which non-filesystem chroots are mounted (e.g. block
devices and LVM snapshots).
.TP
LIBEXEC_DIR
The directory under which helper programs are located.
.TP
PID
The process ID of the schroot process.
.TP
SESSION_ID
The session identifier.
.TP
CHROOT_SESSION_CREATE
Set to \[oq]true\[cq] if a session will be created, otherwise \[oq]false\[cq].
.TP
CHROOT_SESSION_CLONE
Set to \[oq]true\[cq] if a session will be cloned, otherwise \[oq]false\[cq].
.TP
CHROOT_SESSION_PURGE
Set to \[oq]true\[cq] if a session will be purged, otherwise \[oq]false\[cq].
.TP
CHROOT_TYPE
The type of the chroot.  This is useful for restricting a setup task to
particular types of chroot (e.g. only block devices or LVM snapshots).
.TP
CHROOT_NAME
The name of the chroot.  This is useful for restricting a setup task to a
particular chroot, or set of chroots.
.TP
CHROOT_DESCRIPTION
The description of the chroot.
.TP
CHROOT_MOUNT_LOCATION
The location to mount the chroot.  It is used for mount point creation and
mounting.
.TP
CHROOT_LOCATION
The location of the chroot inside the mount point.  This is to allow multiple
chroots on a single filesystem.
.TP
CHROOT_PATH
The absolute path to the chroot.  This is typically CHROOT_MOUNT_LOCATION and
CHROOT_LOCATION concatenated together.  This is the path which should be used
to access the chroots.
.TP
CHROOT_MOUNT_DEVICE
The device containing the chroot root filesystem.  This is only set for chroots
which require mounting.
.SS Plain and directory chroot variables
These chroot types use only general variables.
.SS File variables
.TP
CHROOT_FILE
The file containing the chroot files.
.TP
CHROOT_FILE_REPACK
Set to \[oq]true\[cq] to repack the chroot into an archive file on ending a
session, otherwise \[oq]false\[cq].
.SS Block device variables
.TP
CHROOT_DEVICE
The device containing the chroot root filesystem.  This is usually, but not
necessarily, the device which will be mounted.  For example, an LVM snapshot
this will be the original logical volume.
.TP
CHROOT_MOUNT_OPTIONS
Options to pass to
.BR mount (8).
.SS LVM snapshot variables
.TP
CHROOT_LVM_SNAPSHOT_NAME
Snapshot name to pass to
.BR lvcreate (8).
.TP
CHROOT_LVM_SNAPSHOT_DEVICE
The name of the LVM snapshot device.
.TP
CHROOT_LVM_SNAPSHOT_OPTIONS
Options to pass to
.BR lvcreate (8).
.SH FILES
.SS \f[BI]@SCHROOT_CONF_SETUP_D@\fP
The system-wide chroot setup directory.
.TP
\f[BI]00check\fP
Print debugging diagnostics and perform basic sanity checking.
.TP
\f[BI]05file\fP
Unpack, clean up, and repack file-based chroots.
.TP
\f[BI]05lvm\fP
Create and remove LVM snapshots.
.TP
\f[BI]10mount\fP
Mount and unmount filesystems.
.TP
\f[BI]20network\fP
Configure networking by copying resolv.conf from the host system.
.TP

the host system.
.TP
\f[BI]50chrootname\fP
Set the chroot name (\fI/etc/debian_chroot\fP) in the chroot.  This may be used
by the shell prompt to display the current chroot.
.TP
\f[BI]50sbuild\fP
If
.BR sbuild (1)
is installed, set up the build directories, including ownership and
permissions, inside the chroot for use by sbuild.
.SS \f[BI]@SCHROOT_CONF_EXEC_D@\fP
The system-wide chroot execution directory
.TP
\f[BI]00check\fP
Print debugging diagnostics and perform basic sanity checking.

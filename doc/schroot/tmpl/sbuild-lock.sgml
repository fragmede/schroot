<!-- ##### ENUM SbuildLockType ##### -->
<para>
The type of lock.  A shared lock may be held simultaneously by many
processes, whereas an exclusive lock may only be held by only one
process.  If a shared lock is already held by another process, a
shared lock may be acquired, but not an exclusive lock.  If an
exclusive lock is held by another process, both shared and exclusive
lock acquisition will fail.
</para>

@SBUILD_LOCK_SHARED: A shared (read) lock.
@SBUILD_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE: An exclusive (write) lock.
@SBUILD_LOCK_NONE: No lock.

Welcome to schroot 0.2.0.  Please read these release notes carefully.

Full installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.  The
README file also contains more specific notes regarding building and
configuration.

* Major changes in 0.2.0:

  The source has been rewritten in C++, and documented with Doxygen.

* Major changes in 0.1.7:

  1) The chroots now implement locking to restrict access to chroots
     which are already in use.

  2) The "current-users" and "max-users" configuration options have
     been removed.  These have been obsoleted by chroot locking.

  3) The command-line options "--all-chroots" and "--all-sessions"
     have been added, which have similar behaviour to "--all", but
     selects all chroots and all active sessions, respectively.

  4) Session creation, use and removal is now available for LVM
     snapshot chroots, using the options documented in schroot(1).

  5) The session commands also work with non-session-based chroot
     types (plain and block-device), but is equivalent to using the
     chroot normally.

  6) An init script is used to recover (restore) session chroots at
     system startup.

  7) If no chroot is specified, schroot will fall back to using the
     "default" chroot.  Adding a "default" alias to an existing chroot
     will make this chroot the default.

* Major changes in 0.1.6:

  1) Setup scripts may be run on startup and shutdown and before and
     after a command in order to perform setup tasks such as
     configuring the chroot and mounting filesystems.  These are
     stored in /etc/schroot/setup.d and /etc/schroot/run.d, and run
     using run-parts(8).  New scripts may easily be added by the
     system administrator.  See schroot-setup(5).

  2) Different types of chroots are now supported.  The current types
     are "plain" (the default, which is the type supported by previous
     releases), "block-device" (a block device mounted on the fly) and
     "lvm-snapshot" (and LVM snapshot of an LV made on the fly).

* Major changes in 0.1.5:

  1) The authentication system has been extended to remove the
     dependency upon libpam_misc.  There are no user-visible changes.

  2) The root user (uid 0) no longer has special priveleges during
     authentication.  If the root user should have special priveleges
     (such as not requiring authentication to change to any other
     user), do the following:

     - uncomment the pam_rootok.so line in pam.d/schroot.  This will
       disable the requirement for root authentication.
     - add root to groups (root_groups membership is redundant), so
       that root is allowed access.

  3) The configuration file, /etc/schroot.conf has been moved to
     /etc/schroot/schroot.conf.  This should be moved automatically
     when upgrading the Debian package.

  4) A new directory, /etc/schroot/setup.d has been added.  This
     contains scripts to perform setup and cleanup tasks in the
     chroot, which are run with run-parts(8).  This provides an
     easy was to configure and customise chroots.

* Major changes in 0.1.4:

  1) A new chroot configuration option, "priority", has been added.
     This is intended for use with sbuild, to indicate whether the
     distribution in a chroot is older than the distribution in
     another chroot.
  2) The printed messages displaying the command or shell being run
     now correctly inform the user if the shell is a login shell or
     not.

* Major changes in 0.1.3:

  1) HOME, LOGNAME and USER are set in the environment if the old
     environment is not being preserved.
  2) schroot now aborts earlier if no chroots are defined in
     schroot.conf, rather than failing with a confusing failed
     assertion error.
  3) An option parsing bug which could sometimes cause a crash has
     been fixed.

* Major changes in 0.1.2:

  1) Support for gettext has been added, to allow localisation into
     any language.
  2) If a command is specified, it will be searched for in $PATH.
     Previously, an absolute path was always required.

* Major changes in 0.1.1:

  1) Add a large number of pointer checks.

* Major changes in 0.1.0:

  1) Initial release.
  2) Debian packaging created.

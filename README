schroot
=======

Securely enter a chroot and run a command or login shell.

Note that giving untrusted users root access to chroots is a bad idea.
Although they will only have root access to files inside the chroot,
in practice there are many obvious ways of breaking out of the chroot
or disrupting services on the host system.  As always, this boils down
to trust.  Don't give root access to chroots to users you would not
trust with root access to the host system.

For compatibility with existing tools and scripts, wrapper binaries
for dchroot and DSA dchroot are provided.


Build Dependencies
------------------

An ISO C++ compiler supporting TR1 (e.g. GCC 4.0), or an ISO C++
compiler and the Boost libraries
libstdc++ (GNU libstdc++)
libpam0g-dev (Linux-PAM)
liblockdev1-dev
libuuid-dev
libboost-dev                 } The Boost C++ libraries
libboost-program-options-dev }

If building from Subversion, you will also need:
gettext (0.15)
doxygen


Translation
-----------

If you would like to see the schroot messages output in your own
language, please consider translating the pot file (po/schroot.pot).


Building and installation
-------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for generic installation instructions.
Note that the testsuite ("make check") should be run under fakeroot or
real root in order to work correctly.  There are the following
additional options:

  --enable-dchroot:      Build dchroot.
  --enable-dchroot-dsa:  Build DSA dchroot
  --enable-debug:        Enable debugging features (not recommended)


Configuration
-------------

See schroot.conf(5) and schroot-setup(5).


Running
-------

See schroot(1).

schroot
=======

Securely enter a chroot and run a command or login shell.

Note that giving untrusted users root access to chroots is a bad idea.
Although they will only have root access to files inside the chroot,
in practice there are many obvious ways of breaking out of the chroot
or disrupting services on the host system.  As always, this boils down
to trust.  Don't give root access to chroots to users you would not
trust with root access to the host system.

Build Dependencies

libpam0g-dev (Linux-PAM)
liblockdev1-dev
libuuid-dev
libboost-dev                 } The Boost C++ libraries
libboost-program-options-dev }

Translation
-----------

If you would like to see the schroot messages output in your own
language, please consider translating the pot file (po/schroot.pot).
You will need to join the appropriate language team at the Free
Translation Project (http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/) in
order to submit your translation.

Building and installation
-------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for generic installation instructions.
Note that the testsuite ("make check") should be run under fakeroot or
real root in order to work correctly.

Configuration
-------------

See schroot.conf(5) and schroot-setup(5).

Running
-------

See schroot(1).

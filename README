schroot
=======

Securely enter a chroot and run a command or login shell.

Note that giving untrusted users root access to chroots is a serious
security risk!  Although the untrusted user will only have root access
to files inside the chroot, in practice there are many obvious ways of
breaking out of the chroot and of disrupting services on the host
system.  As always, this boils down to trust.  Don't give chroot root
access to users you would not trust with root access to the host
system.

For compatibility with existing tools and scripts, wrapper binaries
for dchroot and DSA dchroot are provided.


Build Dependencies

libstdc++ (GNU libstdc++)
libpam0g-dev (Linux-PAM)
liblockdev1-dev
libboost-dev                 }
libboost-program-options-dev } The Boost C++ libraries
libboost-regex-dev           }
uuid-dev (e2fsprogs)

If building from GIT, you will also need:

Translation
-----------

If you would like to see the schroot messages output in your own
language, please consider translating the pot file (po/schroot.pot).


Building and installation
-------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for generic installation instructions.
Note that the testsuite ("make check") should be run under fakeroot or
real root in order to work correctly.  There are the following
additional options:

  --enable-dchroot:      Build dchroot
  --enable-dchroot-dsa:  Build DSA dchroot
  --enable-debug:        Enable debugging features (not recommended)


Configuration
-------------

See schroot.conf(5) and schroot-setup(5).


Running
-------

See schroot(1).

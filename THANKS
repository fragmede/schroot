schroot was originally written by Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>.
It would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these
people:

Andreas Bombe           <aeb@debian.org>
Raphaël Hertzog         <hertzog@debian.org>
Steve Langasek          <vorlon@debian.org>
Martin Michlmayr        <tbm@debian.org>
Lucas Nussbaum          <lucas@debian.org>
Adeodato Simó           <adeodato@debian.org>
        For many suggestions, feature requests and bug reports.
        Without their destruction testing and help, schroot would not
        have been pushed as far as it has.

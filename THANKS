schroot was originally written by Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>.
It would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these
people:

Ben Hutchings <benh@debian.org>
	Help with many C++ problems, especially the intricacies of
	templates and other obscure and annoying language features.

Andreas Bombe <aeb@debian.org>
Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>
Martin Michlmayr <tbm@debian.org>
Adeodato Sim√≥ <adeodato@debian.org>
	For many suggestions, feature requests and bug reports.
	Without their destruction testing and help, schroot would not
	have been pushed as far as it has.

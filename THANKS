schroot was originally written by Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>.
It would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these
people:

Andreas Bombe		<aeb@debian.org>
Raphaël Hertzog		<hertzog@debian.org>
Steve Langasek		<vorlon@debian.org>
Martin Michlmayr	<tbm@debian.org>
Lucas Nussbaum		<lucas@debian.org>
Adeodato Simó		<adeodato@debian.org>
	For many suggestions, feature requests and bug reports.
	Without their destruction testing and help, schroot would not
	have been pushed as far as it has.

Ben Hutchings		<benh@debian.org>
	Help with many C++ problems, especially the intricacies of
	templates and other obscure and annoying language features.

Simon Richter		<sjr@debian.org>
	Help with PAM session handling.

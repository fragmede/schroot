     * Authentication handler.
     *
     * auth handles user authentication, authorisation and session
     * management using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
     * library.  It is essentially an object-oriented wrapper around PAM.
     *
     * In order to use PAM correctly, it is important to call several of
     * the methods in the correct order.  For example, it is not possible
     * to authorise a user before authenticating a user, and a session may
     * not be started before either of these have occurred.
     *
     * A conversation handler must be specified using set_conv before
     * calling any of the functions below.
     *
     * The correct order is
     * - start
     * - authenticate
     * - setupenv
     * - account
     * - cred_establish
     * - open_session
     *
     * After the session has finished, or if an error occurred, the
     * corresponding cleanup methods should be called
     * - close_session
     * - cred_delete
     * - stop

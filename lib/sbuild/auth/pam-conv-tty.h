     * This class is an implementation of the auth_pam_conv interface,
     * and is used to interact with the user on a terminal (TTY)
     * interface.
     *
     * In order to implement timeouts, this class uses alarm(2).  This
     * has some important implications.  Global state is modified by the
     * object, so only one may be used at once in a single process.  In
     * addition, no other part of the process may set or unset the
     * SIGALRM handlers and the alarm(2) timer during the time PAM
     * authentication is proceeding.

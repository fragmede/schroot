     * Authentication conversation handler interface.
     *
     * This interface should be implemented by objects which handle
     * interaction with the user during authentication.
     *
     * This is a wrapper around the struct pam_conv PAM conversation
     * interface, and is used by auth when interacting with the user
     * during authentication.
     *
     * A simple implementation is provided in the form of
     * pam_conv_tty.  However, more complex implementations might hook
     * into the event loop of a GUI widget system, for example.
     *
     * The interface allows the setting of optional warning timeout
     * and fatal timeout values, which should default to 0 (not
     * enabled).  This is an absolute time after which a warning is
     * displayed or the conversation ends with an error.
     *
     * Note that the auth object must be specified, and must never be
     * void while the conversation is in progress.

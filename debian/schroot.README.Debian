schroot for Debian
------------------

Other alternative packages to schroot are dchroot and fakechroot.
These serve different needs, and may be more appropriate.  schroot is
a drop-in replacement for dchroot, and offers much more functionality.
fakechroot may be more secure if users want to have some approximation
of root access in a chroot, but you don't want to give them full root
access.

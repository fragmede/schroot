schroot (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release. 
  * Compile and link with POSIX thread support (Closes: #520713).
    libstdc++ std::tr1::shared_ptr does not appear to work
    correctly on Alpha without -pthread, failing during shared_ptr
    construction or assignment due to an failed internal glibc
    assertion while locking a pthread mutex.

    - Update with new GIT source code repository location.
    - Update licence to GPLv3.
  * debian/schroot.init: Update licence to GPLv3.
  * bin/schroot/setup/20network, bin/schroot/setup/30passwd: For files to
    copy, compare file device, inode and contents to avoid copying
    identical files (Closes: #428808).
  * If unknown keys are present in the configuration file, print a warning
    message to alert the user (Closes: #459658).
  * The filesystems to mount in the chroot may be customised by the system
    administrator through the use of an fstab file on a per-chroot basis,
    and a new helper utility, schroot-mount (Closes: #395062, #427047).
    Thanks for your patience while we took the time to implement this the
    right way.
  * Update Vietnamese translation (Closes: #461531).  Thanks to Clytie
    Siddall.
  * debian/schroot.preinst: Add rm_conffile function to remove
    /etc/schroot/setup.d/20network and /etc/schroot/setup.d/30passwd for

schroot (1.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream development release.

    place of reading /var/lib/dpkg/status directly.
  * bin/schroot/setup/10mount: Use --bind rather than --rbind for
    directory chroots.  This allows filesystem mounting to succeed when
    sub-mounts are already mounted on top of the original directory
    (Closes: #428805).  Thanks to Raphaël Hertzog for diagnosing this
    problem.
  * Calling "schroot -e -a" with no open sessions no longer outputs an
    error (Closes: #398679).  Thanks to Benjamin Seidenberg.
  * A new --session-name option allows users to name their sessions,
    rather than using the built-in UUID generation (Closes: #401159).
    Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum.
  * The schroot(1) manual page now has examples for using sessions
    (Closes: #401158).

schroot (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Update package descriptions.
      + Add schroot boilerplate description to schroot-common,

        Craig Sanders.
      + Update schroot boilerplate.
      + Add a list of reasons not to use dchroot and dchroot-dsa instead
        of schroot.
  * Processes running in the chroot on stopping a session are now killed
    by the 15killprocs setup script (Closes: #391319).  Many thanks to
    Kees Cook for implementing this.
  * The 10mount script checks if the output of schroot-listmounts is empty
    before calling umount (Closes: #426416).  Thanks to Federico Di
    Gregorio.

schroot (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream development release.
  * debian/control
    - Remove libsbuild1 dependency from libsbuild-dev.
    - libsbuild1-dev is in Section devel.
    - Use ${source:Version} to allow binNMUs.
    - Add new package, libsbuild-doc.
    - schroot-common Replaces schroot (<< 1.1.1).  Thanks to Hamish Moffatt
      and Adeodato Simó for reporting this bug (Closes: #422741, #422863).
  * debian/rules:
    - Split arch-dependent and arch-independent packages into separate
      rules.
    - Remove .map and .md5 files from the Doxygen docs.
  * debian/libsbuild-doc.docs: New file.  Install doxygen HTML
    documentation and tag file.
  * debian/libsbuild-doc.doc-base: Register docs with doc-base.
  * bin/schroot/setup/10mount: Don't exec schroot-listmounts in a
    subshell.  This prevents an error (such as a bad exit status) from
    being noticed by the script, and as a result failure to umount
    filesystems may result in severe dataloss when stop scripts then "rm
    -rf" the chroot.  Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum for reporting this bug, and
    Frans Pop for suggesting the solution (Closes: #422909).  Urgency is
    set high because this is a critical bug.

    for "plain" chroots, by using bind mounts.  This enables the setup
    scripts to run properly.  Thanks to Adeodato Simó for this idea
    (Closes: #354257).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Feb 2006 00:04:10 +0000

schroot (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Remove Glib from the build dependencies.
  * debian/control: Add versioned depends on libpam0g-dev >= 0.79-3.1,
    because earlier versions have broken headers, due to redefining
    internal glibc/libstdc++ types.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Feb 2006 23:21:07 +0000

schroot (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    successfully.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Jan 2006 18:32:23 +0000

schroot (0.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Use /usr/lib rather than ${prefix}/lib for
    libexecdir, to avoid unexpanded shell vars in config.h.
  * debian/schroot.init: Remove "function" bashism.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Nov 2005 19:41:42 +0000

schroot (0.1.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/schroot.init: Remove "function" bashism.  Applied patch
    from upstream CVS (Closes: #337761).  Thanks to Robert Luberda
    for the patch.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Nov 2005 19:46:36 +0000

schroot (0.1.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * schroot/sbuild-sessions.c: Don't check for supplementary group
    IDs if there are none available, and check the process' GID in
    addition.  This allows session recovery at startup, since init
    does not appear to set supplementary groups.  Applied patch
    from upstream CVS (Closes: #337628).
  * debian/rules: Use /usr/lib rather than ${prefix}/lib for
    libexecdir, to avoid unexpanded shell vars in config.h.

schroot (0.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Don't run setup scripts by default, because this can cause
    data loss with custom chroot setups.  A "run-setup" chroot
    option has been added to configure the running of setup
    scripts, which are disabled by default for safety
    (Closes: #329403).
  * Manual pages say "schroot" rather than "sbuild" (Closes: #331550).
  * Preserve schroot.conf changes correctly when moving to
    /etc/schroot/schroot.conf, by checking the md5sum to
    detect local modifictions.  If not modified, delete and
    replace with the package version.
  * debian/rules: Set $localstatedir when running configure.

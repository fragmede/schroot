schroot (1.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Per-chroot custom mountpoints are now possible through the use of an
    fstab file.  This may be used to mount or bind mount any filesystem
    within the chroot with the assistance of a helper utility,
    schroot-mount.  Set FSTAB=fstab in the script-config file to specify
    which file to use.

  * Per-chroot custom file copying is now supported.  Set COPYFILES=file
    in the script-config file to specify a file containing a list of files
    to copy from the host system into the chroot.  This change merged the
    20network and 30passwd setup scripts into a single script,
    20copyfiles.  If you previously customised either of these scripts,
    the changes will need to be copied over to the new files.

Package: schroot-common
Architecture: all
Description: common files for schroot
 This package provides files common to all schroot packages, such as
 translations.

Package: libsbuild-dev
Architecture: any
Section: devel
Depends: pkg-config (>= 0.14.0)
Description: development files for the Debian source builder
 sbuild provides facilities to manage and access chroots.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 develop applications which make use of sbuild.  Once the API and ABI
 are stable, a shared library will replace the static library.

Description: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells
 in different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be
 created, and access permissions given to each, including root
 access for normal users, on a per-group basis.  Additionally,
 schroot can switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM
 for authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged
 for security.
 .
 Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files and LVM snapshots
 are also supported.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with
 all supported chroot types, including sessions.
 .
 schroot shares most of its options with dchroot, but offers vastly
 more functionality.

Package: dchroot
Architecture: any
Suggests: debootstrap
Depends: schroot (= ${Source-Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, schroot-common (=${source:Version})
Description: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 dchroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as
 necessary.

Package: dchroot-dsa
Architecture: any
Suggests: debootstrap
Depends: schroot (= ${Source-Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, schroot-common (=${source:Version})
Description: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 dchroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as
 necessary.
 .
 This package provides a dchroot-dsa binary which is compatible with
 the command-line options and configuration file format used by the
 dchroot-dsa dchroot maintained by the Debian System Administrators
 used on machines administered for the Debian Project.

Description: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells
 in different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be
 created, and access permissions given to each, including root
 access for normal users, on a per-group basis.  Additionally,
 schroot can switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM
 for authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged
 for security.
 .
 Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files and LVM snapshots
 are also supported.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with
 all supported chroot types, including sessions.
 .
 schroot shares most of its options with dchroot, but offers vastly
 more functionality.  A dchroot compatibility wrapper is also
 provided, offering the same functionality as the dchroot package.

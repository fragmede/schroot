  /**
   * Authentication handler.
   *
   * auth handles user authentication, authorisation and session
   * management using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
   * library.  It is essentially an object-oriented wrapper around PAM.
   *
   * In order to use PAM correctly, it is important to call several of
   * the methods in the correct order.  For example, it is not possible
   * to authorise a user before authenticating a user, and a session may
   * not be started before either of these have occurred.
   *
   * The correct order is
   * - start
   * - authenticate
   * - setupenv
   * - account
   * - cred_establish
   * - open_session
   *
   * After the session has finished, or if an error occurred, the
   * corresponding cleanup methods should be called
   * - close_session
   * - cred_delete
   * - stop
   *
   * The run method will handle all this.  The run_impl virtual
   * function should be used to provide a session handler to open and
   * close the session for the user.  open_session and close_session
   * must still be called.

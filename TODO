All new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html

PENDING
-------

* Make "session" naming more consistent.
  "run-session-scripts" should be "run-scripts".

* Allow direct access to the original LV of a snapshot chroot type.
  This is possible now we are using lockdev.  Could the block-device
  chroot be created automatically, appending "-master" or "-source" to
  the lvm-snapshot chroot name?

* C++ transition

** Translation of strings in headers.

PLANNED
-------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add a SbuildChrootFile chroot type for archived chroots.

  Autodetect the file format (tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, zip), and unpack
  into a temporary location.  This type is session-based, like an LVM
  snapshot.

  Also consider an option for repacking on session-stop.  This must be
  root-only/root-groups-only for security.

PENDING
-------

* Make "session" naming more consistent.
  "run-session-scripts" should be "run-scripts".

* Allow direct access to the original LV of a snapshot chroot type.
  This is possible now we are using lockdev.  Could the block-device
  chroot be created automatically, appending "-master" or "-source" to
  the lvm-snapshot chroot name?

* C++ transition

** Remove all C/GLib type usage.

** Enable C++ compiler warnings.

** Convert inline docs into Doxygen format to replace gtk-doc.

** const correctness of references.

** Message newlines and warning levels.

** Use Boost.Format to do type-safe message formatting, replacing
   the sbuild::format_string vsnprintf() wrapper.

PLANNED
-------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add a SbuildChrootFile chroot type for archived chroots.

  Autodetect the file format (tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, zip), and unpack
  into a temporary location.  This type is session-based, like an LVM
  snapshot.

  Also consider an option for repacking on session-stop.  This must be
  root-only/root-groups-only for security.

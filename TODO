Most new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html

PENDING
-------

* Make "session" naming more consistent.
  "run-session-scripts" should be "run-scripts".

* Translation of strings in headers.

PLANNED
-------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.


POTENTIAL
---------

* Repacking session chroot on session-stop.

  This must be root-only/root-groups-only for security.  For
  ChrootFile, tar or zip the chroot in place of the old one.  For
  LvmSnapshot chroots, this would require copying back the chroot
  contents.

* Add tests for

** Auth
** AuthConv
** AuthConvTty
** AuthMessage
** Session
** schroot::Options
** schroot_releaselock::Options

None of these are urgent and/or are difficult to test in an automated
fashion.  expect might be useful for testing the PAM wrappers.

TODO
----

* Document the setup and session scripts.
  Include all scripts and ordering.

* Add init script to autorecover sessions.
  Run --recover-session on all sessions.

* Add examples of new chroot types to schroot.conf.
  Use all available options.

* Make "session" naming more consistent.
  "run-session-scripts" should be "run-scripts".

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Allow direct access to the original LV of a snapshot chroot type.
  This is possible now we are using lockdev.  Could the block-device
  chroot be created automatically, appending "-master" or "-source" to
  the lvm-snapshot chroot name?


SECURITY
--------

Should schroot be converted to C++ for security, or is glib secure
enough?  Please get in touch if you have any thoughts.

Most new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html


PENDING
-------

* Add more informative debugging messages

  - in the critical parts of the session code.


PLANNED
-------

* Add API to run multiple commands to replace auth::run().


POTENTIAL
---------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add tests for

** Auth
** AuthConv
** AuthConvTty
** AuthMessage
** Session
** schroot::Options
** schroot_releaselock::Options

None of these are urgent and/or are difficult to test in an automated
fashion.  expect might be useful for testing the PAM wrappers.

* Add tests for dchroot classes.

* Line reporting while parsing config files misses file name.

  log_warning() is used, because we don't throw an exception.  The
  code has no knowledge of the file name, so can't report it.
  Outright errors throw, and the handler adds the needed context.

* keyfile parsing doesn't error out on duplicated groups.

  This is OK for keyfiles (warning only), but should it be stricter
  for use in specifying chroots?  Both schroot.conf and dchroot.conf
  warn about duplicates.

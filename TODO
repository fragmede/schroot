TODO
----

* Chroot locking should return a GError.

* Refactor LVM snapshot session file locking.

* The session names should include the source chroot name.

* Session operations only operate on one chroot.
  Check only one is set.

* Document the setup and session scripts.
  Include all scripts and ordering.

* Add examples of new chroot types to schroot.conf.
  Use all available options.

* Make "session" naming more consistent.

* config: add methods to clear and reload configuration.
  This will require a file and directory list to be stored.

* Add a "recover" option to setup scripts
  Existing session filesystems must be remounted after a reboot.

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Allow direct access to the original LV of a snapshot chroot type.
  This is possible now we are using lockdev.  Could the block-device
  chroot be created automatically, appending "-master" or "-source" to
  the lvm-snapshot chroot name?


SECURITY
--------

Should schroot be converted to C++ for security, or is glib secure
enough?  Please get in touch if you have any thoughts.

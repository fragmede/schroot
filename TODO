Most new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html


PENDING
-------

* Translation of strings in headers.

PLANNED
-------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add API to run multiple commands to replace auth::run().

POTENTIAL
---------

* root group should not need to be in groups.

* Add tests for

** Auth
** AuthConv
** AuthConvTty
** AuthMessage
** Session
** schroot::Options
** schroot_releaselock::Options

None of these are urgent and/or are difficult to test in an automated
fashion.  expect might be useful for testing the PAM wrappers.

* Add tests for dchroot classes.

Most new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html


PENDING
-------


PLANNED
-------

* Add API to run multiple commands to replace auth::run().


POTENTIAL
---------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add tests for

** Auth
** AuthConv
** AuthConvTty
** AuthMessage
** Session
** schroot::Options
** schroot_releaselock::Options

None of these are urgent and/or are difficult to test in an automated
fashion.  expect might be useful for testing the PAM wrappers.

* Add tests for dchroot classes.

* Line reporting while parsing config files misses file name.

  log_warning() is used, because we don't throw an exception.  The
  code has no knowledge of the file name, so can't report it.
  Outright errors throw, and the handler adds the needed context.

Most new TODO items are marked @todo in the source code and listed in
the Doxygen-generated documentation in doc/schroot/html/todo.html


PENDING
-------

* Update documentation schroot.conf examples.

* Review quoting style.

  Use of single and double quotes in strings is inconsistent.  Needs
  the boost::format markup changes fixing first.  What are other
  projects doing?

* Use boost::format markup in the standard error strings.

  This will complete the i18n support for error translation.  It will
  also allow templated exceptions which will simplify error reporting
  for non-string types.


PLANNED
-------

* Move PAM open_session and close_session logic.

  Move back from session to auth, or don't open the session in the
  child process (because the open/close happen in different
  processes).

* Docstring argument namespace usage.

  Doxygen is currently failing to parse correct C++ due to what looks
  like namespace bugs in doxygen.  It would be great if we could fix
  the code by fully qualifying the namespace where appropriate.

* Add API to run multiple commands to replace auth::run().


POTENTIAL
---------

* Add a SbuildChrootXen chroot type for Xen hosts.

  This will require setup scripts for e.g. hostname and network setup.
  It will require DHCP or static IP configuration and a dynamic
  hostname in order to connect.

* Add tests for

** Auth
** AuthConv
** AuthConvTty
** AuthMessage
** Session
** schroot::Options
** schroot_releaselock::Options

None of these are urgent and/or are difficult to test in an automated
fashion.  expect might be useful for testing the PAM wrappers.

* Add tests for dchroot classes.

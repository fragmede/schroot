.TH SCHROOT.CONF 5 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
schroot.conf \- chroot definition file for schroot
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[BI]schroot.conf\fP is a plain UTF-8 text file, describing the chroots
available for use with schroot.
.PP
Comments are introduced following a \[oq]\f[CR]\[sh]\fP\[cq] (\[lq]hash\[rq])
character at the beginning of a line, or following any other text.  All text
right of the \[oq]\f[CR]\[sh]\fP\[cq] is treated as a comment.
.PP
The configuration format is an INI-style format, split into groups of key-value
pairs separated by section names in square brackets.
.SS
General options
.PP
A chroot is defined as a group of key-value pairs, which is started by a name
in square brackets on a line by itself.  The file may contain multiple groups
which therefore define multiple chroots.
.PP
A chroot definition is started by the name of the chroot in square brackets.
For example,
.IP
\f[CR]\[lB]sid\[rB]
.PP
This is then followed by several key-value pairs, one per line:
.TP
\f[CBI]type=\fP\f[CI]type\fP
The type of the chroot.  Valid types are \[oq]plain\[cq], \[oq]directory\[cq],
\[oq]file\[cq], \[oq]loopback\[cq], \[oq]block\-device\[cq] and
\[oq]lvm\-snapshot\[cq].  If empty or omitted, the default type is
\[oq]plain\[cq].
.TP
\f[CBI]description=\fP\f[CI]description\fP
A short description of the chroot.  This may be localised for different
languages; see the section \[lq]\fILocalisation\fP\[rq] below.
.TP
\f[CBI]priority=\fP\f[CI]number\fP
Set the priority of a chroot.  \f[CI]number\fP is a positive integer indicating
whether a distribution is older than another.  For example, \[lq]oldstable\[rq]
and \[lq]oldstable-security\[rq] might be \[oq]0\[cq], while \[lq]stable\[rq]
and \[lq]stable-security\[rq] are \[oq]1\[cq], \[lq]testing\[rq] is \[oq]2\[cq]
and \[lq]unstable\[rq] is \[oq]3\[cq].  The values are not important, but the
difference between them is.  This is used by sbuild and wanna-build.
.TP
\f[CBI]users=\fP\f[CI]user1,user2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of users which are allowed access to the chroot.  If
empty or omitted, no users will be allowed access (unless a group they belong
to is also specified in \f[CI]groups\fP).
.TP
\f[CBI]groups=\fP\f[CI]group1,group2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed access to the chroot.  If
empty or omitted, no groups of users will be allowed access.
.TP
\f[CBI]root\-users=\fP\f[CI]user1,user2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of users which are allowed \fBpassword-less\fP root
access to the chroot.  If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed root
access without a password (but if a user or a group they belong to is in
\f[CI]users\fP or \f[CI]groups\fP, respectively, they may gain access with a
password).  See the section \[lq]\fISecurity\fP\[rq] below.
.TP
\f[CBI]root\-groups=\fP\f[CI]group1,group2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed \fBpassword-less\fP root
access to the chroot.  If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed root
access without a password (but if a user or a group they belong to is in
\f[CI]users\fP or \f[CI]groups\fP, respectively, they may gain access with a
password).  See the section \[lq]\fISecurity\fP\[rq] below.
.TP
\f[CBI]aliases=\fP\f[CI]alias1,alias2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of aliases (alternate names) for this chroot.  For
example, a chroot named \[lq]sid\[rq] might have an \[oq]unstable\[cq] alias
for convenience.
.TP
\f[CBI]run\-setup\-scripts=\fP\f[CI]true\fP|\f[CI]false\fP
Set whether chroot setup scripts will be run.  The default is to run setup
scripts for all chroot types except \[oq]plain\[cq].  Setup scripts are
\fBrequired\fP to mount and configure the chroot environment.  This option is
deprecated and no longer used by schroot, but is still permitted to be used; it
will be obsoleted and removed in a future release.
.TP
\f[CBI]run\-exec\-scripts=\fP\f[CI]true\fP|\f[CI]false\fP Set whether chroot
execution scripts will be run.  The default is the same as the default for the
\f[CI]run\-setup\-scripts\fP key.  This option was called
\f[CI]run\-session\-scripts\fP in versions prior to 0.2.5.  This option is
deprecated and no longer used by schroot, but is still permitted to be used; it
will be obsoleted and removed in a future release.
.TP
\f[CBI]script\-config=\fP\f[CI]filename\fP
The behaviour of the chroot setup scripts may be customised on a per-chroot
basis by providing a shell script which the scripts will source.  The filename
is relative to \fI@PACKAGE_SYSCONF_DIR@\fP.  The default filename is
\[oq]script\-defaults\[cq].  The recommended method of customisation is to copy
this script and amend the copy; or alter the original to set the defaults for
all chroots.  Settings for specific chroots may also be set in a single script
by using conditionals checking the chroot name and/or type.  Note that the
setup script will be sourced once for each and every script invocation, and
must be idempotent.  The file format is documented in
.BR schroot-script-config (5).
.TP
\f[CBI]command\-prefix=\fP\f[CI]command,option1,option2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of a command and the options for the command.  This
command and its options will be prefixed to all commands run inside the chroot.
.TP
\f[CBI]personality=\fP\f[CI]persona\fP
Set the personality (process execution domain) to use.  This option is useful
when using a 32-bit chroot on 64-bit system, for example.  Valid options on
Linux are \[oq]bsd\[cq], \[oq]hpux\[cq], \[oq]irix32\[cq], \[oq]irix64\[cq],
\[oq]irixn32\[cq], \[oq]iscr4\[cq], \[oq]linux\[cq], \[oq]linux32\[cq],
\[oq]linux_32bit\[cq], \[oq]osf4\[cq], \[oq]osr5\[cq], \[oq]riscos\[cq],
\[oq]scorvr3\[cq], \[oq]solaris\[cq], \[oq]sunos\[cq], \[oq]svr4\[cq],
\[oq]uw7\[cq], \[oq]wysev386\[cq], and \[oq]xenix\[cq].  The default value is
\[oq]linux\[cq].  There is also the special option \[oq]undefined\[cq]
(personality not set).  For a 32-bit chroot on a 64-bit system,
\[oq]linux32\[cq] is the option required.  The only valid option for non-Linux
systems is \[oq]undefined\[cq].  The default value for non-Linux systems is
\[oq]undefined\[cq].
.TP
\f[CBI]environment\-filter=\fP\f[CI]refex\fP
The environment to be set in the chroot will be filtered in order to remove
environment variables which may pose a security risk.  Any environment variable
matching the specified POSIX extended regular expression will be removed prior
to executing any command in the chroot.
.IP
Potentially dangerous environment variables are removed for safety by default
using the following regular expression:
\[lq]\f[CR]^(BASH_ENV\:|CDPATH\:|ENV\:|HOSTALIASES\:|IFS\:|KRB5_CONFIG\:|KRBCONFDIR\:|KRBTKFILE\:|KRB_CONF\:|LD_.*\:|LOCALDOMAIN\:|NLSPATH\:|PATH_LOCALE\:|RES_OPTIONS\:|TERMINFO\:|TERMINFO_DIRS\:|TERMPATH)$\fP\[rq].
.SS
Plain and directory chroots
.PP
Chroots of type \[oq]plain\[cq] or \[oq]directory\[cq] are directories
accessible in the filesystem.  They implement the \fBfilesystem union 
chroot\fP options (see \[lq]\fIFilesystem Union chroot options\fP\[rq], 
below).  The two types are equivalent except for the fact that if 
\f[CI]run\-setup\-scripts\fP is set to \[oq]true\[cq] for
\[oq]plain\[cq] chroots, filesystem mounting is disabled.
.PP
These chroot types have an additional (mandatory) configuration option:
.TP
\f[CBI]directory=\fP\f[CI]directory\fP
The directory containing the chroot environment.  This is where the root will
be changed to when executing a login shell or a command.  The directory must
exist and have read and execute permissions to allow users access to it.  Note
that on Linux systems it will be bind-mounted elsewhere for use as a chroot;
the directory for \[oq]plain\[cq] chroots is mounted with the \fI\-\-rbind\fP
option to
.BR mount (8),
while for \[oq]directory\[cq] chroots \fI\-\-bind\fP is used instead so that
sub-mounts are not preserved.
.IP
This option was previously named \f[CI]location\fP, but was renamed to avoid
ambiguity with the option by the same name for \fBmountable chroot\fP options
(see \[lq]\fIMountable chroot options\fP\[rq], below).  The name
\f[CI]location\fP is deprecated, but still valid; it will be obsoleted and
removed in a future release.  It is recommended to use \f[CI]directory\fP
rather than \f[CI]location\fP.  Note that it is an error to use both
\f[CI]directory\fP and \f[CI]location\fP at the same time.
.SS
File chroots
.PP
Chroots of type \[oq]file\[cq] are files on the current filesystem containing
an archive of the chroot files.  They implement the \fBsource chroot\fP options
(see \[lq]\fISource chroot options\fP\[rq], below) and have an additional
(mandatory) configuration option:
.TP
\f[CBI]file=\fP\f[CI]filename\fP
The file containing the archived chroot environment.  This must be a tar (tape
archive), optionally compressed with gzip or bzip2, or a zip archive.  The file
extensions used to determine the type are are \fI.tar\fP, \fI.tar.gz\fP,
\fI.tar.bz2\fP, \fI.tgz\fP, \fI.tbz\fP and \fI.zip\fP.  This file must be owned
by the root user, and not be writable by other.
.SS
Loopback chroots
.PP
Chroots of type \[oq]loopback\[cq] are a filesystem available as a file on
disk, accessed via a loopback mount.  The file will be loopback mounted and
unmounted on demand.  They implement the \fBmountable chroot\fP options (see
\[lq]\fIMountable chroot options\fP\[rq], below), plus an additional option:
.TP
\f[CBI]file=\fP\f[CI]file\fP This is the filename of the file containing the
filesystem, including the absolute path.  For example,
\[lq]/srv/chroot/sid\[rq].
.SS
Block device chroots
.PP
Chroots of type \[oq]block\-device\[cq] are a filesystem available on an
unmounted block device.  The device will be mounted and unmounted on demand.
They implement the \fBmountable chroot\fP options (see \[lq]\fIMountable chroot
options\fP\[rq], below), plus an additional option:
.TP
\f[CBI]device=\fP\f[CI]device\fP
This is the device name of the block device, including the absolute path.  For
example, \[lq]/dev/sda5\[rq].
.SS
LVM snapshot chroots
.PP
Chroots of type \[oq]lvm\-snapshot\[cq] are a filesystem available on an LVM
logical volume (LV).  A snapshot LV will be created from this LV on demand, and
then the snapshot will be mounted.  At the end of the session, the snapshot LV
will be unmounted and removed.  For each chroot of this type, a corresponding
\[oq]block\-device\[cq] chroot will be created, with a \fI\-source\fP suffix
appended to the chroot name and all its aliases; this is for convenient access
to the source device.
.PP
They implement the \fBsource chroot\fP options (see \[lq]\fISource chroot
options\fP\[rq], below), and all the options for \[oq]block\-device\[cq], plus
an additional option:
.TP
\f[CBI]lvm-snapshot-options=\fP\f[CI]snapshot_options\fP
Snapshot options.  These are additional options to pass to lvcreate(8).  For
example, \[lq]\-L 2g\[rq] to create a snapshot 2 GiB in size.
.B Note:
the LV name (\fI\-n\fP), the snapshot option (\fI\-s\fP) and the original LV
path may not be specfied here; they are set automatically by schroot.
.SS Source chroot options
.PP
Some chroots implement source chroots.  These are chroots which automatically
create a copy of themselves before use, and are usually session managed.  These
chroots also provide an additional chroot with a \fI\-source\fP suffix added to
their name, to allow access to the original data, and to aid in chroot
maintenance.  These chroots provide the following additional options:
.TP
\f[CBI]source\-users=\fP\f[CI]user1,user2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of users which are allowed access to the source chroot.
If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed access.  This will become the
\f[CI]users\fP option in the source chroot.
.TP
\f[CBI]source\-groups=\fP\f[CI]group1,group2,...\fP
A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed access to the source chroot.
If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed access.  This will become the
\f[CI]groups\fP option in the source chroot.
.TP
\f[CBI]source\-root\-users=\fP\f[CI]user1,user2,...\fP
 A comma-separated list of users which are allowed \fBpassword-less\fP root
access to the source chroot.  If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed
root access without a password (but if a user is in \f[CI]users\fP, they may
gain access with a password).  This will become the \f[CI]root\-users\fP option
in the source chroot.  See the section \[lq]\fISecurity\fP\[rq] below.
.TP
\f[CBI]source\-root\-groups=\fP\f[CI]group1,group2,...\fP
 A comma-separated list of groups which are allowed \fBpassword-less\fP root
access to the source chroot.  If empty or omitted, no users will be allowed
root access without a password (but if a user's group is in \f[CI]groups\fP,
they may gain access with a password).  This will become the
\f[CI]root\-groups\fP option in the source chroot.  See the section
\[lq]\fISecurity\fP\[rq] below.
.SS Mountable chroot options
Some chroots implement device mounting.  These are chroots which require the
mounting of a device in order to access the chroot.  These chroots provide the
following additional options:
.TP
\f[CBI]mount-options=\fP\f[CI]mount_options\fP Mount options for the block
device.  These are additional options to pass to
.BR mount (8).
For example, \[lq]\-o atime,sync,user_xattr\[rq].
.TP
\f[CBI]location=\fP\f[CI]path\fP
This is the path to the chroot \fIinside\fP the filesystem on the device.  For
example, if the filesystem contains a chroot in \fI/chroot/sid\fP, you would
specify \[lq]/chroot/sid\[rq] here.  If the chroot is the only thing on the
filesystem, i.e. \fI/\fP is the root filesystem for the chroot, this option
should be left blank, or omitted entirely.
.SS Filesystem Union chroot options
Some chroots allow to create a session using filesystem unions to overlay the
real data and redirect all modifications to a session-dependant directory.
To activate this feature you have to set the \f[CI]fs-union-type\fP to any
supported value.  If \[lq]\fIFilesystem Union\fP\[rq] is enabled the chroot
will also be a \fBsource chroot\fP, which wil provide additional options
(see \[lq]\fISource chroot options\fP\[rq], above).  All entries are optional.
.TP
\f[CBI]fs-union-type=\fP\f[CI]type\fP
Allows to set the used filesystem.  This is especially important, if you use
the \fIfs-branch-config\fP option to specify different options.  Currently
supported filesystems are \[oq]aufs\[cq] and \[oq]unionfs\[cq].  Default is 
\[oq]none\[cq], so this feature is disabled.
.TP
\f[CBI]fs-union-branch-config=\fP\f[CI]branch_config\fP
The branch configuration is used for the first filesystem in the 
\fIfs-union-type\fP filesystem list.  It replaces the complete \[lq]\-o\[rq] 
string for mount and allows to make complex filesystem unions.
.B Note:
You can use the variables \[lq]${CHROOT_FS_UNION_OVERLAY_DIRECTORY}\[rq] and
\[lq]${CHROOT_LOCATION}\[rq] in this option string, which will be replaced
with the writeable session directory and the source-chroot directory.
.TP
\f[CBI]fs-union-overlay-base=directory
This specifies the base directory, where the session writeable directories
will be created. Default is \[oq]@SCHROOT_OVERLAY_DIR@\[cq].
.SS Localisation
.PP
Some keys may be localised in multiple languages.  This is achieved by adding
the locale name in square brackets after the key name.  For example:
.br
.RS
\f[CR]description[en_GB]=\f[CI]British English translation\fP\fP
.br
.RE
.PP
This will localise the \f[CI]description\fP key for the en_GB locale.
.RS
\f[CR]description[fr]=\f[CI]French translation\fP\fP
.br
.RE
.PP
This will localise the \f[CI]description\fP key for all French locales.
.br
.SH SECURITY
Note that giving untrusted users root access to chroots is a \fBserious
security risk\fP!  Although the untrusted user will only have root access to
files inside the chroot, in practice there are many obvious ways of breaking
out of the chroot and of disrupting services on the host system.  As always,
this boils down to \fItrust\fP.
.B Don't give chroot root access to users you would not trust
.B with root access to the host system.
